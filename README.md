FileEncryptionSystem
Overview

FileEncryptionSystem is a Java console application that allows users to securely manage text files with encryption and decryption.
The system includes user registration, login with password, two-factor authentication (OTP), and file operations such as writing, reading, sharing, and viewing metadata.

It uses XOR-based encryption for simplicity and ensures that file content is only accessible to authenticated users.
